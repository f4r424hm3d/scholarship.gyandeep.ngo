            <p class="fs18 text-justify">All visitors and applicants are encouraged to read the following policy before
              completing the registration form. If the applicant does not understand the clauses specified, Mudra
              Education will not be held liable.</p>
            <p class="fs18 text-justify">The fee for filling out the application form is non-refundable. (Once a
              candidate's application is submitted online for an offline application, the fee of the application form is
              instantly non-refundable.)</p>
            <p class="fs18 text-justify">Only applicants who enrol in any Gyandeep NGO participating institute are
              eligible for the Mudra Scholarships on Tuition Fee reductions. As for the cash prizes students should be
              eligible for all the criteriaâ€™s specified individually for every Scholarship. It is advisable to all the
              candidates to study all the instructions given carefully prior to register for the Scholarship examinations.
              The scholarship cannot be transferred to any other candidate's name. As previously indicated, scholarships
              will be awarded solely to qualified and meritorious students.</p>
            <p class="fs18 text-justify">After verification of documentation and receipt, the scholarship will be awarded
              by check, which will be issued 'Account Payable' in the name of the concerned candidate.</p>
            <p class="fs18 text-justify">For admitted students, the complete price for any programme may be paid on an
              annual basis. These fees must be paid within 10 days after receiving an offer of admission.</p>

          <p class="fs18 text-justify">The Gyandeep NGO Board assumes no responsibility for any delays in transit
            resulting from the university's receipt and delivery of any communication to the applicant.</p>
          <p class="fs18 text-justify">Fees are non-refundable after the start of the course, or if the student stops
            attending or leaves before the end of the course, or if the University suspends the student for non-attendance
            or misbehaviour. In such circumstances, Mudra would have no responsibility.</p>
          <p class="fs18 text-justify">Those who have been granted temporary admission due to the non-declaration of their
            qualifying examination results must submit their marks sheet before taking the University examination, or
            before the University examination, whichever comes first. Prior to the exam, such students will be admitted
            only after submitting an affidavit proving their eligibility. In any scenario, there will be no refund of
            money. Please note that after a candidate is assigned to a college, Mudra has no involvement in any situation
            that develops between the college and the candidate. The student and the college to which he or she has been
            admitted are responsible for all matters.</p>
